# MyConfigFiles
This is the repository where I store my config files for vim and zshrc, with an installer

### Basic Installation

My config files are installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.

#### via curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seluj78/myconfigfiles/install.sh)"
```

#### via wget

```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seluj78/myconfigfiles/install.sh -O -)"
```
